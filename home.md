This is the front page. Check out the [About me](#About) page to check all what Gabor wants to know about us. This serves as a link between them because that is also what he wants from us.

## Tasks which we should do
1. Have at least two pages in your GitHub pages website. Link between them.

1. Update your GitHub profile to include your name and picture, if that's ok with you.

1. Update your Github page to include information about your studies. Relevant links. A link to your page in Weizmann, if you have one.

1. On your new web site create a page called exercism and list all the exercises you finished linking to the solution like this: Scrabble Score and also add who mentored on it: mentored by szabgab or like this: mentored by Gabor Szabo

1. Start to write a "diary" of what you study. It is enough to keep your notes of this course on that page, but you can also include notes from other studies. (Remember it is a public page so don't put any secrets there.) Include links to pages on other web-sites as necessary. It would be nice to also include some images on this page.

1. Create another Github repo which you'll use to create HTML-based web site. If you call the repo web it will be available as USERNAME.github.il/web. Create the docs/ directory and an index.html file in it. Continue building your web-site partially using plain HTML.
